## Abstract
---
- A collection of handy python scripts that automate tedious markdown file operations. Maybe eventually I can turn them into a markdown manipulation CLi tool, who knows


### Obtain Markdown Meta Data
>[!code]- List markdown files from smallest to biggest
> Usually bigger file means more content, while smaller file means can be merged or removed 
> ```python
> import os
> 
> def get_markdown_files(directory):
>     """Recursively finds all Markdown files in a directory and its subdirectories.
> 
>     Args:
>         directory: The path to the directory to search.
> 
>     Returns:
>         A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
>             * The filename (str)
>             * The file size in bytes (int)
>     """
> 
>     markdown_files = []
>     for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
>         if 'Omnivore' in dirs:
>             dirs.remove('Omnivore')
>         for filename in files:
>             if filename.endswith('.md') and not filename.endswith('excalidraw.md'):
>                 filepath = os.path.join(root, filename)
>                 filesize = os.path.getsize(filepath)
>                 markdown_files.append((filename, filesize))
>     return markdown_files
> 
> def main():
>     current_directory = os.getcwd()  # Get the current working directory
>     files = get_markdown_files(current_directory)
> 
>     # Sort files by size (ascending)
>     files.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
> 
>     # Print the results
>     for filename, filesize in files:
>         print(f"{filename:<40} {filesize} bytes")
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()
